**Author**: Chris L Chapman
**Version**: 0.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

 scaffolding a new Django application to help manage some of your basic financials, though probably best to not put any actual data in here just yet! Your focus today is scaffolding, deployment and implementing the new class-based view controllers in place of function views.

## Getting Started

clone the repo
docker-compose up [--build possibly]
If port 5432 is already busy, from command line:
    sudo service postgresql stop

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
